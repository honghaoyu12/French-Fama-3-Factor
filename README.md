# French-Fama-3-Factor
This is a repository of the illustration of the French Fama 3-factor model

Essentially, it is a practice of linear regression.  The notebook is a replication of the original repository(https://github.com/pranav0904/Fama-French-Three-Factor-Model), and I have made some improvements and modifications (It seems the original poster confused the CAPM and the French Fama model and I have made corrections).

I have added remarks and modified a few things as personal learning process.
